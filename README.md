This project gathers useful JVM classes for the mrjob hadoop streaming
framework.  Use the uberjar built by this project as an argument to
hadoop-streaming's -libjars option to use the classes below.

This is a shameless copy of the [Oddjob](https://github.com/jblomo/oddjob) project, ported to Java.  This
project targets hadoop 2.4.0 (the currently supported EMR  version), but should work on any recent version.
