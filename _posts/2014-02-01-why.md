Ever wanted to split your Hadoop streaming output into multiple directories?  How about filtering by multiple keys
in a single pass?

Nick Nack makes your Hadoop streaming jobs even better by hooking into the rich support for [writing to multiple outputs](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/output/MultipleOutputs.html)
that Hadoop offers.  This library (and further documentation) is tailored for working
with [mrjob](https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob), but can be used with any Hadoop streaming job.
